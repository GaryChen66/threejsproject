# Getting Started with the Serverless Framework and AWS

First things first, let's get the Serverless Framework open source CLI installed on your machine.

```bash
# Install the serverless cli
npm install -g serverless

# Or, update the serverless cli from a previous version
npm update -g serverless
```

If you don’t already have **[Node 6](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)** or higher on your machine, you’ll need to do that first.

Once you have the Serverless Framework installed, simply run the ‘serverless’ command and follow the prompts. In no time you will have deployed your first serverless app using the Serverless Framework **[CLI](./providers/)** and configured your Serverless Framework **[Dashboard](./dashboard/)** account to automatically monitor your serverless app, generate alerts, and much more.

```bash
# Create and deploy a new service/project
serverless
```
